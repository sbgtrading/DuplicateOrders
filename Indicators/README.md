## Example: ARC_ATR Indicator

The Average True Range (ATR) indicator in the ARC suite measures market volatility:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The Average True Range (ATR) is a measure of volatility. It was introduced by Welles Wilder in his book 'New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems'

/// </summary>
```

It includes options for different calculation methods:
- Arithmetic
- Exponential
- Wilder (default)
